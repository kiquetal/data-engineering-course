# Data Engineering Course - Jupyter Notebook Setup

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2:x. **Install dependencies (including Jupyter Notebook)**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # If you want to install Jupyter Notebook directly:
   pip install notebook
   ```

3. **Start Jupyter Notebook**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser. You can then create or open `.ipynb` files to start working.

## Notes
- Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system.
- You can install additional packages by adding them to `requirements.txt` and running the install command again.
- Using a virtual environment helps keep your project dependencies isolated.
