### Data Generatin in Source Systems.


### Unpredictables systems - Source systems

- Chnage in data
- Change in the definition of the systems


### Ingestion from source systems

- How often we need to move the data from source systems?


- Batch vs Streaming

Batch: based on predertermined time interval
Based on preset size threshold


Straming: new real-time,need to have a infra.


What to consider 

real-time actions. maintaenance, downtime,money, time.


### Storage


Bottom Layer: disk, memory
Middle Layer: storage systems
Top Layer: storage abstractions

### Queries, Modeling and Transformation

Choosing a coherent structure for your data to make it useful for the business.

Data transformation: Data manipulated, enhanced and saved for downstream use.


### Serving data

Embedded Analytcs: external or customer-facing analytics

Business Intelligence:  explore historical and current business data to discover
insights.

Operational Analytics: Monitoring real-time data for immediate action

### Introduction to the Undercurrents

- Security: Principle of Least Privilees: give users or application access to only the services and only with a timestamp


- Data sensitivity: mask

- Is about people too

- Defensive method [be cautious with sensistivie data, design for potenial attacks]

### Data Management

Is the development, execution and supervision of plans, progams and practices
taht deliver control, protect and enhance the value of data and information
assets throughout their life cycles.


Data governance, is the first and foremost, a data manegemnt funciton to ensuire the
quality, integrity, security and usability of data collected by organization 

Data quality: accurate, complete, discovrable, available in a timely manner
Low quality data: inaccurate, incomplete, hard to find, late


### Data architecture

Is the design of system to support the evolving data needs of an enterprise, achieved by flexible and reversible decisionr eached through a careful evaluation of trade-off
Principles:

- Choose common component wisely
- Plan for failure
- Architect for scalability
- Architecture is leadership
- Always be architecting 
- Build loosely couple systems
- Make reversible decisions
- Priority security
- Embrace FinOps

### DataOps
It's a set of culture habits and practices
Improves the development process and quality of data products.


Automation, Observability and Monitoring, Incident Response



### Orchestration

No only pure-scheduling

Airflow

### Software engineering


The design, development,deployment and maintenance of software applications
